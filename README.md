**Analysis of World Development Statistics using SAS**

World development indicators represent a comprehensive framework for measuring and analyzing global development trends. These indicators serve as a compass guiding policymakers, researchers, and development practitioners toward informed decision-making.
The scope of WDIs is all-encompassing, reaching into the realms of economics, education, health, environment, and much more. These indicators are pivotal in assessing not just the well-being of nations but also the disparities and inequalities that persist.

In this project we have considered the factors such as GDP, HDI - life expectancy, Global Peace Index, Gender Inequality index, Literacy rate, unemployment ratio and many more.
And for the analysis, we have used statistical analytic methods like multiple rgression, binary logistic regression, factor analysis, cluster analysis and chi-square test of independence. 
From the analysis, we were able to decipher a developed country did not have high peace index and gender equality. Country being developed or not did not have an effect on the social factors.
